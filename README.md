# STM32-Voice-Recorder
This Project main objective is creating a digital voice recorder that can record voice, playback a voice, and delete data from EEPROM. The modules that are going to be used in this Project are Timer, PWM, ADC and External Interrupts. According to the numbers pressed from the keypad, stats must be realized. These stats are named record, playback and clear.
